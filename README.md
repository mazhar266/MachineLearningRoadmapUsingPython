Mostly Python use for Machine Learning project because of it's vast number of packages. Moreover it's very resourceful for learners. That's why i personaly use Python for Machine Learning purpose. 

Now lets go step by step process to learn Machine Learning.

**Step 1: Learn basic Python**
   - Choose your preffered way to learn bacis concepts of *Python*. There are may ways from where anyone can learn *Python*. Such as books, video tutorial, reading tutorial etc.
   - Learn basic Algorithms and Data Structures using *Python*. [GeeksforGeeks Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) for basic Algorithms. [GeeksforGeeks Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) for basic Data Structures. Click Python tab for *Python* codes. Keep practice either just viewing code. Only viewing code and do noting is totally useless. You just waste your time by only viewing codes.
   
**Step 2: Learn some basic Machine Learning Python Packages**
   - Start with some basic *Python* packages as follows
     - [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
     - [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/)
     - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
     - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html)
     - [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html)

**Step 3: Practice Linear Algebra, Statistics and Probability with Python**
   - So now we have basic concepts of avobe mentioned packages. Let's practice some maths with those packages.
     - [Practice Linear Algebra with Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.linalg.html)
     - [Practice Statistics and Plotting with Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/1.5.1/examples/statistics/index.html)
     - [Practice Probability with Python and NumPy](https://www.python-course.eu/python_numpy_probability.php)
     
   - Please find more on your own and learn, send an edit request to the list, and if I find the change substantial, I will approve it.

**Step 4: Let's Start with Machine Learning**
   - We start learning Machine Learning now,for that we first need to know the theoretical concept of Machine Learning. For that we may follow the [CS156 from Caltech by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A)
